## Data & Methodology

- **Data file:** ![FMGE_Data](FMGE_Data_Analysis.xlsx)
- **Data visualization files** ![NEET Exam Statistics]([NEET Exam Statistics.png](FMGE-Data-Story/blob/main/NEET%20Exam%20Statistics.png)), ![FMGE Exam's % Pass Rate vs. Year](FMGE-Data-Story/blob/main/%25%20Pass%20Rate%20vs.%20Year.png) and ![Top 10 destinations for Foreign MBBS](FMGE-Data-Story/blob/main/Top%2010%20Destinations.png).

This analysis was conducted using a rigorous, multi-stage workflow leveraging Google Sheets for all data operations. Year-wise FMGE results were individually downloaded as PDF documents from the official National Board of Examinations in Medical Sciences‚Äô website (https://natboard.edu.in/). Each PDF was converted into Excel format using specialized online tools to ensure accurate data extraction.

The Excel files representing different years were integrated into a single `.xlsx` workbook, with every year‚Äôs data housed in a dedicated sheet. For in-depth country-wise analysis, summary sheets were meticulously developed using advanced spreadsheet functions such as `COUNTIF` and `SUMIF` to aggregate results across all years.

Data cleaning was performed with a focus on precision:
- **Repetitions and missing information** were resolved through careful sorting, filtering, and de-duplication.
- **Inconsistent country names** (e.g., alternate spellings, abbreviations, or informal references) were standardized using lookup tables, naming conventions, and automated functions including `IFERROR` to handle exceptions.
- All steps ensured robust harmonization of data for downstream analysis.

Analytical operations included the use of functions like `VLOOKUP`, `SUM`, and various arithmetic operations to generate key metrics and insights. A `final_result` summary sheet was constructed to distill the cleaned, consolidated data into actionable narratives and core findings.

For data visualization, a series of interactive and static bar charts were produced directly within Google Sheets, spotlighting trends, comparisons, and summary statistics critical to stakeholders. The entire analytical process demonstrates proficiency in large-scale data management, advanced spreadsheet techniques, data cleaning, transformation, and compelling data storytelling‚Äîensuring results are transparent, reproducible, and relevant for diverse audiences.


## Key Insights

- Only **1 in 22** NEET applicants secures an MBBS seat in India.
- From **297,757** foreign MBBS graduates, just **22%** passed the FMGE (2019‚Äì2024).
- Pass rates vary sharply by country; new destinations are rising, but with mixed outcomes.
